Version 2.5.0 of ALGENCAN introduces a new Fortran 90 version of
Algencan with several major modifications (most of them related to the
usage of dynamic memory). The Acceleration Process was revisited, a
stopping criterion for infeasible stationary points of an
infeasibility measurement was added, and many minor updates and
corrections were made.
